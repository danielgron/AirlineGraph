# AirlineGraph
Implemented using a linked list based Graph, as the provided matrix implementation grows quadratic in complexity

Running the AirportImport.java in the project will run through what has been done in order.
1)
a) Breadth first search:
Done through a helper method that takes a Graph, root and target and returns true if the two are connected.

b) Depth first search:
Done through a helper method that takes a Graph, root and target and returns true if the two are connected.

2)
Finding shortest path distance

3)
Finding shortest path time

4)
Widest coverage MST
